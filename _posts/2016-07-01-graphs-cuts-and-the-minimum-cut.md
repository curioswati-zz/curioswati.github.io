### Graphs
========

**Introduction**

In its most formal definition, A graph is a set of vertices and edges. In Computer science, it is a data type used to represent relationships or connections.

**Examples**:
Road Networks, The Web, Social Networks, Precedence Constraints, Biological Structures, Computer chip design etc.

A Graph has two main ingredients:

* Vertices (_set of vertices is represented by 'V' generally in Algorithms_).
* Edges (_pair of vertices, set of edges is represented by 'E' generally_).
<br>
<br>

**Types**

There are two types of graphs mainly:

* Directed - A graph where the vertices are unordered pairs for a given edge.

* Undirected - When vertices are an ordered pair.

So that was a sort of refresher to graphs for those who are familiar with it already.
Those who are very unfamiliar with the term should consider reading about them first.

### Cuts
=====

**Definition**

A cut is a partition of the vertices of a Graph into two non-empty sets A and B. 

For example, if G(V, E) is a graph then a cut will devide V into two non-empty sets
where some edges will remain in either A or B and some will cross the cut (_**crossing edges**_).

**Examples:**

1. Directed Graph   2. Undirected Graph

### The Minimum Cut
===================

**Problem Definition:**

In Graph Theory, the minimum cut problem is to find a cut with minimum number of crossing edges.
<br>
<br>


**Use of a Minimum Cut**

There are many applications of the minimum cut. Few are listed below:

* Identifying Network Bottlenecks.
* Community detection in Social Networks.
* Image Segmentation.
* In recommendation systems.

**How to find a minimum cut**

Here is the Karger's algorithm to compute a minimum cut in a given graph.

    while number of vertices > 2:
        - pick a remaining edge(u, v) uniformly at random
        - merge u and v into a single vertex
        - remove self-loops
    return cut represented by final 2 vertices

Now, I can't share the code due to some reasons. But I will try to elaborate using pseudocode.

    make adjacency list for the graph:
      graph = []
      for every vertex:V in graph:
        graph.append(V, all adjacent vertices of V) 

    find min_cut:
      copy(graph)
      while length of graph > 2:

        choose a random index                : selecting random edge
        capture first and second element of index row 
        merge the captured elements into one : This is our contraction stage

        for every vertex:V in graph:
          if V[0] is the second captured element:
            remove the row for V 
          if first captured element in V:
            remove first captured element
          if second captured element in V:
            remove second captured element
          if first or second captured element were removed:
            V.append(merged vertex)

      pick the min(left two vertex lists):List
      for each element:E in List:
        sum(ocurrences of E)

      sum_of_occurences - len(List)

That's it.

This will give the minimum number of cuts a given graph can have.
The algorithm is randomized so it requires 3-4 continuous runs to find the exact answer.
This algorithm can be used for many applications along with the few mentioned above.
